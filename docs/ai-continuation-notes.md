For the longer staged roadmap, see `docs/ai-streameye-roadmap.md`. Keep this
file focused on current state, rules, and the next practical work.

## Current State

ZStreamEye is a Qt 6 / FFmpeg desktop bitstream analysis tool. The app has a
frame/access-unit list, property tree, log dock, stats dock, bitstream hex dock,
OpenGL video canvas, playback controls, overlays, JSON/CSV/screenshot export,
and persisted UI settings.

Core architecture:

- `MainWindow` delegates decoded-frame/access-unit cache state to
  `AnalysisStore` and background thread lifecycle to `DecodeSession`.
- `FFmpegDecoder` owns FFmpeg contexts, but stream probing, parser creation,
  packet raw-data capture, and codec-neutral access-unit parsing are pushed
  into focused helpers (`FFmpegStreamInfoBuilder`, `ParserFactory`,
  `PacketRawDataBuilder`, `AccessUnitAnalyzer`).
- `DecodeWorker` is now a thin Qt bridge over `DecodeLoop`.
- `DecodeLoop` is an orchestration layer composed from small helpers
  (`DecodeEventSink`, `DecodeSeekPlanner`, `RebufferProgressTracker`,
  `SeekCheckpointEmitter`, `FramePacing`, `PendingAccessUnitDispatcher`,
  `FirstFramePauseController`, `DecodedFrameAnalysisBuilder`,
  `DecodedFrameDispatcher`).
  Video remains the selected playback path.
- `FrameAnalysis` is the codec-neutral handoff model used by UI, stats, and
  export.
- `StreamInfo` records discovered container streams and basic video/audio
  metadata.
- `AnalysisStats` aggregates access-unit, frame-type, macroblock, QP, motion
  vector, and diagnostic summaries.
- `BitstreamHexView` highlights selected packet byte ranges from
  `AnalysisBitField` metadata.
- Audio parser skeletons exist for AAC ADTS and MP3 frame headers. They emit
  access-unit metadata and diagnostics, but there is no audio playback or deep
  audio syntax parsing yet.
- HEVC has a shallow parser skeleton for NALU/VPS/SPS/PPS/VCL classification
  and graceful unsupported diagnostics. It does not parse full HEVC slice
  headers yet.

H.264 is the deepest parser and is intentionally a direct bitstream parser, not
a wrapper around FFmpeg's H.264 parser.

## H.264 Parser Map

Important H.264 files:

- `H264Parser.cpp`: packet/NALU dispatch, decoder configuration parsing, parser
  state snapshots, SPS/PPS cache management, and top-level helpers.
- `H264ParameterSetParser.cpp`: SPS/PPS/VUI parsing.
- `H264SliceHeaderParser.cpp`: slice header parsing, reference-list summaries,
  prediction-weight summaries, and decoded-reference-picture marking summaries.
- `H264MacroblockParser.cpp`: `slice_data` flow, skip-run handling,
  CAVLC/CABAC dispatch, and top-level unsupported/truncation handling.
- `H264SliceDataContext.h`: internal shared macroblock parsing context,
  diagnostics helpers, and small bit-field readers.
- `cavlc/H264CavlcMacroblockParser.*`: CAVLC macroblock syntax orchestration,
  including macroblock type, intra/P/B syntax, and coded-block pattern flow.
- `cavlc/H264CavlcMacroblockResidualParser.*`: macroblock-level CAVLC residual
  prediction/dispatch and coefficient-state updates.
- `cavlc/H264CavlcResidualParser.*`: CAVLC residual block parsing and coefficient
  summaries.
- `H264MotionVectorParser.*`: motion-vector prediction, MV state updates, and
  supported P/B partition mapping.
- `H264MacroblockTypes.*`: macroblock type naming and coded-block-pattern
  mapping.
- `cabac/H264CabacContextModel.*`: CABAC context-model initialization
  tables/helpers. The covered subset currently reaches ctxIdx 252, including
  the coded-block-pattern, `mb_qp_delta`, luma4x4/chroma DC
  coded-block-flag contexts, and the luma4x4
  `significant_coeff_flag` ctxIdx 134-148 and
  `last_significant_coeff_flag` ctxIdx 166-180 contexts plus the
  first through fourth luma4x4 `coeff_abs_level_minus1` prefix contexts used
  by the narrow CABAC paths and near-term residual work.
- `cabac/H264CabacDecoder.*`: CABAC arithmetic-decoder foundation.
- `cabac/H264CabacSyntaxTypes.h`: shared result structs for CABAC syntax
  readers.
- `cabac/H264CabacMacroblockSyntaxReader.*`: CABAC macroblock-level syntax
  readers. It currently covers `mb_skip_flag`, `mb_type` prefix bins, I-slice
  `I_NxN`/`I_16x16`/`I_PCM`, and P-slice `P_L0_16x16`,
  `P_L0_L0_16x8`, `P_L0_L0_8x16`, plus `P_8x8` detection. It also has a
  narrow `coded_block_pattern == 0` reader with luma ctxIdx derivation over
  contexts 73-76 and first chroma context 77; non-zero luma/chroma CBP still
  returns incomplete. It also has a narrow `mb_qp_delta == 0` reader for future
  residual-bearing paths; non-zero `mb_qp_delta` returns incomplete.
- `cabac/H264CabacSubMacroblockSyntaxReader.*`: focused P sub-macroblock
  readers for `sub_mb_type`, narrow `ref_idx_l0 == 0`, and narrow
  `mvd_l0` scaffolding. MVD now covers zero and small non-zero components
  (`abs(mvd_l0) <= 3` with bypass sign); larger absolute values still return
  incomplete.
- `cabac/H264CabacResidualSyntaxReader.*`: focused residual CABAC syntax
  skeleton. It currently reads luma 4x4 `coded_block_flag` using ctxIdx 85 for
  luma 8x8 groups selected by the luma `coded_block_pattern_luma` bits, and
  chroma DC `coded_block_flag == 0` using ctxIdx 97 for 4:2:0
  `coded_block_pattern_chroma == 1`. For luma4x4 `coded_block_flag == 1`, it
  reads the 15 explicit `significant_coeff_flag` bins with ctxIdx 134-148.
  If one of those flags is one, it reads the matching
  `last_significant_coeff_flag` with ctxIdx 166-180, stores the partial scan
  indices/flags, continues the significant map when the last flag is zero, and
  if the last flag is one reads the first
  `coeff_abs_level_minus1` prefix bin with ctxIdx 248. If that first prefix
  bin is one, it reads one additional prefix bin with ctxIdx 252, a third
  prefix bin with ctxIdx 253, and a fourth prefix bin with ctxIdx 254. If any
  covered prefix step reaches a zero terminal bin, it reads one bypass
  `coeff_sign_flag` and then stops at `residual_coefficients`; if the covered
  prefix bins do not terminate, the next unsupported stage remains the rest of
  `coeff_abs_level_minus1`. If no last significant
  coefficient is found in the 15 explicit bins, the reader treats scan position
  15 as the inferred final coefficient and reads the same narrow
  `coeff_abs_level_minus1` prefix skeleton before stopping. Coefficient-level
  partial results now carry reverse-scan coefficient order plus an explicit
  inferred-final flag, so consumers do not need to infer that state from scan
  index 15. The reader consumes only the first two coefficients in that reverse
  order. Chroma non-zero CBF, complete
  significant/last maps, complete
  coefficient level parsing, suffix parsing, and non-zero coefficient completion are
  not implemented.
- `cabac/H264CabacSyntaxReader.h`: aggregate include for CABAC syntax readers;
  keep it thin.
- `cabac/H264CabacMacroblockParser.*`: CABAC macroblock entry point. It currently
  initializes CABAC state, collects supported syntax into
  `H264CabacMacroblockSyntaxResult`, can append a partial P_8x8
  `MacroblockInfo` skeleton for decoded sub-macroblock syntax, then reports
  structured unsupported/incomplete diagnostics.

Current H.264 coverage:

- SPS/PPS/slice headers with bit-field metadata where practical.
- Common CAVLC I/P macroblock parsing, QP, coded-block pattern, residual block
  counts, and focused non-zero coefficient summaries.
- P-slice L0 motion vectors for supported partition paths, including focused
  P_8x8/P_8x8ref0 fixtures.
- Focused non-direct B-slice L0/L1/Bi motion vectors for 16x16/16x8/8x16.
- Structured diagnostics for unsupported CABAC, B_Direct, B_8x8, MBAFF/FMO,
  malformed/truncated SPS/PPS/slice data, and malformed AVCC lengths.

Current H.264 limitations:

- CABAC macroblock model parsing is not implemented. Groundwork includes
  `cabac_init_idc` on `SliceInfo`, `H264SliceDataContext`, a context-based
  CABAC unsupported entry point, `cabac/H264CabacContextModel.*`, and
  `cabac/H264CabacDecoder.*` bin-decoding primitives. CABAC context-model
  initialization currently covers ctxIdx 0-252, including B-slice skip/type
  starter contexts, P-slice `ref_idx_l0` starter contexts, coded-block-pattern
  contexts, `mb_qp_delta`, luma4x4/chroma DC residual `coded_block_flag`
  contexts, and luma4x4 `significant_coeff_flag` ctxIdx 134-148 and
  `last_significant_coeff_flag` ctxIdx 166-180 contexts plus the first through
  fourth luma4x4 `coeff_abs_level_minus1` prefix contexts.
  The CABAC macroblock entry point has a syntax-result boundary for supported
  I/P `mb_type` and narrow P_8x8
  `sub_mb_type`/`ref_idx_l0 == 0`/small `mvd_l0` scaffolding. The P_8x8 path
  now reads narrow `coded_block_pattern` after MVD syntax. It appends a parsed
  macroblock when CBP is zero, and also for one deliberately narrow CBP-nonzero
  case: luma-only CBP with one or more luma CBP bits and all selected luma4x4
  `coded_block_flag` values equal zero, luma4x4 CBF-one with 15 explicit
  `significant_coeff_flag` bins and matching covered
  `last_significant_coeff_flag` bins preserved as an incomplete result, or
  4:2:0 `coded_block_pattern_chroma` equal to 1 with both chroma DC
  `coded_block_flag` values equal zero. Both non-zero paths require
  `mb_qp_delta == 0`. If a covered luma4x4 coded-block flag is one, parsing now
  preserves partial CBF indices, CBF values, significant scan indices/flags,
  last-significant scan indices/flags, coefficient reverse-scan order,
  coefficient-level scan indices, inferred-final flags, first and next prefix
  bins, and sign flags, incomplete block, incomplete scan index, category, and
  next unsupported stage on the syntax result before returning
  `cabac_residual_incomplete`. Chroma DC
  non-zero CBF remains an incomplete boundary without significant-flag parsing.
  For
  `coded_block_pattern_chroma == 2`, the narrow path now preserves chroma DC
  CBF-zero state, then returns `cabac_residual_incomplete` with category
  `chroma_ac` and next stage `coded_block_flag`; chroma AC CBF parsing is still
  not implemented. Non-4:2:0 chroma residual, MVD absolute values greater than
  three, non-zero `mb_qp_delta`, and coefficient parsing remain
  unsupported/incomplete at the macroblock entry point. For inter CBP-zero
  macroblocks, `mb_qp_delta` is not present and is deliberately not consumed.
- CAVLC residual summaries are focused analysis data, not full inverse-scan,
  dequantized, or transformed residual visualization.
- B_Direct, B_8x8 sub-macroblock prediction, MBAFF/interlaced, and FMO remain
  unsupported or diagnostic-only paths.

## Build And Verification

For normal Codex/parser work, use the existing utility build:

```powershell
C:\msys64\usr\bin\bash.exe -lc "export PATH=/ucrt64/bin:/usr/bin:$PATH; cd /d/Desktop/ZStreamEye && cmake --build build-codex-util"
C:\msys64\usr\bin\bash.exe -lc "export PATH=/ucrt64/bin:/usr/bin:$PATH; cd /d/Desktop/ZStreamEye && ctest --test-dir build-codex-util --output-on-failure"
```

For a fresh MSYS2 UCRT64 configure/build/test:

```powershell
C:\msys64\usr\bin\bash.exe -lc "export PATH=/ucrt64/bin:/usr/bin:$PATH; cd /d/Desktop/ZStreamEye && cmake -S . -B build-msys2-ucrt -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/ucrt64 -DBUILD_TESTING=ON"
C:\msys64\usr\bin\bash.exe -lc "export PATH=/ucrt64/bin:/usr/bin:$PATH; cd /d/Desktop/ZStreamEye && cmake --build build-msys2-ucrt"
C:\msys64\usr\bin\bash.exe -lc "export PATH=/ucrt64/bin:/usr/bin:$PATH; cd /d/Desktop/ZStreamEye && ctest --test-dir build-msys2-ucrt --output-on-failure"
```

Run the app from the development environment:

```powershell
C:\msys64\usr\bin\bash.exe -lc "export PATH=/ucrt64/bin:/usr/bin:$PATH; cd /d/Desktop/ZStreamEye && ./build-msys2-ucrt/ZStreamEye.exe"
```

Create a portable package:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\deploy-windows-msys2.ps1
```

The deployment script writes its own release build under
`build-deploy-msys2-ucrt` and package output under `dist/`. Do not distribute a
`ZStreamEye.exe` directly from any build directory.

## Important Rules

- Do not commit `build*/`, `build-msys2-ucrt/`, `dist/`, or generated package
  artifacts.
- Do not use FFmpeg's H.264 parser as the main syntax parser.
- Keep decoding, seeking, and heavy parsing off the UI thread.
- Parser failures must be fault tolerant: add structured diagnostics or mark
  unsupported syntax; do not crash.
- Keep parser and general code modular and decoupled.
- CABAC must stay layered: context models, arithmetic decoding, syntax
  dispatch, residual parsing, motion-vector updates, and shared slice state
  should remain separate helpers/files with focused tests.
- Reuse `VideoCanvas` coordinate helpers: `videoDisplayRect()`,
  `mapVideoPointToWidget()`, and `macroblockWidgetRect()`.
- After meaningful code changes, run build and tests. If deployment scripts
  change, run the deployment script too.
- For every release tag, add `docs/releases/<tag>.md` before pushing the tag.

## Parser Change Checklist

- Define module boundaries before implementing complex syntax.
- Keep parser functions narrow. If a function grows past roughly 120-150 lines,
  check whether it mixes syntax reading, derived state, diagnostics, shared
  mutation, and model population.
- For new syntax fields, carry data through the relevant public layers by
  default: parser model, JSON export, `PropertyTreeView`, and tests.
- Unsupported syntax should have a stable diagnostic code, clear message,
  parsed/estimated state, and fixture coverage when practical.
- Test small layers first. For CABAC, test context initialization, arithmetic
  decoder state, and narrow syntax helpers before macroblock integration.
- Keep internal parser plumbing private unless UI/export genuinely needs it.
- Do not couple parser internals to UI code.

## General Code Structure Checklist

- Keep layer ownership clear: UI presents state, decode owns FFmpeg/threading,
  parsers own syntax analysis, models carry stable data, export/statistics
  consume models.
- Prefer explicit adapters or model fields at cross-layer boundaries.
- Keep shared state explicit with small context/state structs instead of long
  parameter lists or hidden globals.
- Add abstractions only when they reduce real coupling or repeated logic.
- Test at the lowest useful layer, then add broader regression coverage.

## Next Parser Work

Recommended next H.264 direction:

1. Broaden the newly wired residual-CABAC path one step at a time. Current
   macroblock coverage is limited to P_8x8 with luma-only CBF-zero residuals,
   luma4x4 CBF-one partial 15-bin `significant_coeff_flag` /
   `last_significant_coeff_flag` skeleton results, inferred final scan-position
   coefficient prefix routing with explicit reverse-scan and inferred-final
   result flags, plus the first `coeff_abs_level_minus1` prefix bin, one
   additional prefix bin when the first prefix bin is one, third and fourth
   prefix bins when the covered prefix bins keep returning one, and one bypass
   `coeff_sign_flag` when the covered prefix bins terminate,
   4:2:0 chroma DC CBF-zero residuals for `coded_block_pattern_chroma == 1`,
   plus a structured chroma AC incomplete boundary for
   `coded_block_pattern_chroma == 2`, all behind `mb_qp_delta == 0`;
   coefficient syntax is still out of scope. Keep syntax-result structs
   separate from final model mutation.
2. Wire only one narrow CABAC macroblock path at a time, preserving structured
   unsupported diagnostics for the first unimplemented syntax element.
3. Keep CABAC modules under `h264/cabac/` and CAVLC modules under `h264/cavlc/`.
   Reuse shared slice state via `H264SliceDataContext`, but keep
   entropy-specific state and tables out of `H264MacroblockParser.cpp`.
4. Next residual step should likely add one very small
   `coeff_abs_level_minus1` prefix/suffix boundary, or continue walking the
   saved reverse-scan coefficient order beyond the first two entries. Do not
   jump directly to full coefficient reconstruction.
5. Preserve structured unsupported diagnostics for paths that are not ready.

Useful H.264 test areas:

- `tests/test_h264_parser.cpp`
- `tests/test_h264_cabac_decoder.cpp`
- `tests/test_h264_cabac_syntax_reader.cpp`
- `tests/fixtures/`
- `tests/test_analysis_stats.cpp`

## Other Useful Context

Playback/seek:

- Recent decoded frames are cached.
- Old-frame cache misses rebuffer from the nearest keyframe/IDR checkpoint.
- Checkpoints preserve enough parser state to resume syntax parsing after seek.
- Rebuffer generation guards prevent stale callbacks from replacing newer UI
  state.

Export/UI:

- `PropertyTreeView` and JSON export should consume stable model data rather
  than scraping UI text or parser internals.
- Avoid drawing analysis text in `VideoCanvas`; use property/status summaries
  because some Windows/OpenGL deployments render QPainter text poorly.
- `PropertyTreeView` caps displayed macroblocks for responsiveness; overlay
  data still uses the parsed macroblock list.

Release/deployment:

- Windows packaging uses a root launcher and places runtime files under
  `runtime/`.
- Release workflow expects `docs/releases/<tag>.md` for tagged releases.
- The installer is not code signed yet.
